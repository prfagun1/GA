 Update Management
 
This tool was designed for automation of system updates, which involves executing database scripts, copying files, stopping environments, keeping process records, procedure logs and backup of updated files.

Updates that took a long time to be made started to be made in a few minutes.
The tool was developed in .Net Core with C #, javascript, HTML and CSS.
